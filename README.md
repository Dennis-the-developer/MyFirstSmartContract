SETTING UP DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
1. I installed the MetaMask chrome extension.
2. Created a metamask account.
3. Visited remix.ethereum.org.
4. Created a new workspace called "MyFirstSmartContract".
5. Created a file called SimpleStorage.sol inside the MyFirstSmartContract workspace.

HOW I WROTE, COMPILED AND DEPLOYED THE SMART CONTRACT
1. I read the fundamentals of Solidity Programming to understand the concept.
2. Followed the steps in the course and wrote my smart contract.
3. I then compiled and deployed the smart contract on my local network.

CHALLENGES I FACED AND HOW I RESOLVED THEM.
I encountered an issue with connecting remix IDE to my github account.
I then watched the recorded video of our google meet call to connect the dots.
Then was able to connect the remix IDE to my github, add remote repo, commit and
then push my solidity codes to github.
